# Human-in-Loop Workflow System with rollback

A modern, full-stack application that demonstrates human-in-loop workflows with AI agents, built with React, Hono, and Cloudflare Workers. This system enables AI agents to request human intervention when needed.

The key part of my design invloves the event log in the context data of the workflows table. The event log acts as the single source of truth to keep track of the current state of the system. Any updates adds to this array, even a rollback would be another addition to this array. A queue has been implemented using qstash. Any service that requires an external agent to require with is pushed to a queue so that the api is not bogged by i/o hangups. The dynamic ui is also managed by a schema which can be updated as depending on our requirements.

On approval of workflow by the manager, an email is sent to the persons name

The rest of this document has been generated using AI to give a rough overview of the overall structure of the project.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd human-in-loop
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `wrangler.toml` file with your Cloudflare configuration:
   ```toml
   [env.development.vars]
   QSTASH_URL = "your-qstash-url"
   QSTASH_TOKEN = "your-qstash-token"
   MAIL_TOKEN = "your-mail-token"
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   npm run studio:dev
   ```

## Quick Start

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts the Vite development server with hot module replacement.

### Database Management
```bash
# Open Drizzle Studio for database inspection
npm run studio:dev

# For production database
npm run studio:prd
```

### Building and Deployment
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Type checking and dry run
npm run check

# Deploy to Cloudflare
npm run deploy
```
